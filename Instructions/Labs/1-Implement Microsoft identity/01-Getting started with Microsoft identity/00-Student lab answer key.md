## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure user interface (UI) changes after the development of this training content. These changes might cause the lab instructions and lab steps to not match up.

The Microsoft Worldwide Learning team updates this training course as the community brings needed changes to our attention. However, because cloud updates occur frequently, you might encounter UI changes before this training content is updated. If this occurs, adapt to the changes and work through them in the labs as needed.
