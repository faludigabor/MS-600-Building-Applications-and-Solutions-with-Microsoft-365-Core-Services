# Exercise 4: Creating webhooks in Microsoft Teams

Webhooks can be used to connect web services to channels and teams in Teams.

You can create two types of webhooks—**incoming** and **outgoing**. Incoming webhooks allow you to connect a channel to a service and outgoing webhooks allow you to send messages to a service.

## Task 1: Setting up a custom incoming webhook

These steps explain how to send a card to a connector.

1. In Microsoft Teams, select the **Apps** icon located in the left navigation. Select **Connectors** then select **Incoming Webhook**.

1. From the dialog, select **Add to a team**.

1. From the **Select a channel to start using Incoming Webhook**, select the **General** channel of the **Training** **Content** team.

1. Click on the **Set up a connector** button.

1. Provide a name. Optionally, upload an image avatar for your webhook and then click **Create**.

1. The dialog window will present a unique URL that will map to the channel. **Copy and save the URL**—you will need to provide it to the outside service.

1. Select the **Done** button. The webhook will now be available in the team channel.

1. The Incoming Webhook should now be available in the **Configured** section.

## Task 2: Post a message to the webhook using PowerShell

1. From the **PowerShell** prompt, enter the following command and replace the `<YOUR WEBHOOK URL>` with the URL you copied from the previous steps when you setup your incoming webhook.

    ```powershell
    Invoke-RestMethod -Method post -ContentType 'Application/Json' -Body '{"text":"Hello World!"}' -Uri <YOUR WEBHOOK URL>
    ```

1. If the POST succeeds, you should see a simple  displayed output by `Invoke-RestMethod`.

1. Check the Microsoft Teams channel associated with the webhook URL. You should see the new card posted to the channel.

## Review

In this exercise, you:

- Used a combination of coding tools and user interfaces to create an incoming webhook.
